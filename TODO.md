OK - Matt wrote: Just fwiw when I do an npm i it removed the git refâ€™d feathers-hooks-common
OK   The generator installs dependencies. It replaces your github one with the latest version on npm.
OK   On the `npm i` the package.json was probably already overridden.
OK - fixed bug that crashed `generate authentication`.
OK - fixed bug that crashed on `generate all` when `generate graphql` had not yet been run.

OK - Enabled Feathers authentication on services for services called in
     GraphQL resolver functions.
     Combined changes for graphql and generator-feathers-plus
     - Summary:
     - params.provider, user & authenticated are copied from the
       graphql service call into the params for every Feathers service call
       in a resolver or BatchLoader.
     - If you need additional props to be copied over, include their names in
       `options.extraAuthProps` and `convertArgsToFeathers`. See below.
     - For custom resolvers or BatchLoaders, you need to record the
       `convertArgsToFeathers()` call as explained in the details.
     - Note you can enable authentication on a Feathers service or graphql
       only if you've run `generate authentication` first.
     - Details:
     - 'content' param in resolver calls now contains
       provider: params.provider, user: params.user &
       authenticated: params.authenticated (if any) from the /graphql call.
     - In `const createdService = createService(options);`
       options.extraAuthProps can pass an array of additional prop names
       to be copied from params to content.
       This allows other auth-related props to be copied into content.
     - The previous `convertArgsToFeathers(args, ast, {...})` is recoded to
       `const convertArgs = convertArgsToFeathers([/* prop names */]);`
       `...`
       `convertArgs(args, content, ast, {...})`
       where the `pop names` would normally be the same names used in
       `options.extraAuthProps`. These are additional props to copy into parms
       for the Feathers service call being made in the resolver function.  
OK - Custom code eye-catchers changed to avoid issues with linters.    
OK - The generated code use/converts to: '// !code:', '// !end', '// !<DEFAULT> code:'            
OK - Custom code is recognized when it starts with: ['// !code:', '// !<> code:',
OK   '//!code:', '// ! code:'];
OK - Custom code is recognized when it ends with: ['// !end', '//!end'];
OK - Changed test suite in 7,500+ places.
OK - Added comments to name.schema.js so people feel more comfortable adding models.
OK - Added uniqueItemProperties (name borrowed from Ajv extensions)
OK   to name.schema.js to identify fields with unique values in collection.
OK - Mongoose model now adds `required: true` for required props.
OK - Mongoose model now adds `unique: true` for uniqueItemProperties props.
OK - Changed design of feathers-gen-specs.json##connections to work with Sequelize
OK - ***** READ THIS **************************************************************
OK - You need to MANUALLY change the prop names in feathers-gen-specs.json##connections
OK   from something like 'postgres+sequelize' to 'sequelize' alone. More likely you'll
OK   be changing 'mongodb+mongodb' to 'mongodb'.  
OK - ******************************************************************************       
- Sequelize
  - Sequelize works with Postgres, MySQL, SQLite and MS SQL server only.  
  - David's generator creates one instance of Sequelize.
  - A Sequelize instance can connect to one database.
  - So a Sequelize instance can connect to one PostgreSQL, or SQLite, etc.
- David's generator, when the Sequelize adapter is selected for a service
  - You are asked to select the DB.
  - The choices include NeDB, memory, etc which would be invalid.
  - You are asked for the DB for every service, even though only 1 DB can be used.
  - src/sequelize.js is written customized for the first DB selected.
  - It is not rewritten on `generate service` effectively making the DB choice meaningless.
  - It is rewritten on `generate connection`, which is how you can reset the DB selected.
- New generator, when a service is being created/changed for Sequelize or Knex
  - Does not ask for a DB if a Sequelize connection already exists.
  - Displays only Postgres, MySQL, SQLite and MSSQL as DB choices.
  - It is rewritten on `generate connection`, which is how you can reset the DB selected. 
OK - Compare David's Sequelize src to ours
OK - Write Sequelize test.
OK - create src/services/name/name.sequelize.js
OK - create src/models/name.model.js for sequelize
OK - create src/models/name.model.js for sequelize user-entity with authentication
OK - moved model templates under templates/src/_model
OK - duplicate oauthProvider code in service and connection
OK - code-fragments.js does a `require` on name.schema.js. This gets the default schema merged with
     custom changes. Only the default schema is wanted. This will mess up the regenerated module.
OK - PUT BACK f+/graphql in package.json for fx/cli-gen-ex
OK - name.schema.*#extensions.graphql.name s/b default to `nameSingular`
OK - put adapter-info into expanded service specs.
OK - adapter-info: use elsewhere?
OK - add f-auth-mgnt fields to graphql auth
OK - `json-schema-deref-sync` converts `type: 'ID'` to `type: 'string'` which is incorrect for primary keys.
     This doesn't seem to be the case.
OK - rename production dependencies
OK - check if any dependencies before scheduling install
OK - mention src/services/name/name.class.*s are not regenerated
OK - alpha order for .ts and in front of the package.json
OK - test f-auth-mgnt fields to graphql auth  
OK - adapter-info: Make sure generic adapter can work somehow. 
OK - test name.sequelize.js
OK - adapter-info: Make sure generic adapter can work somehow.
OK - add
OK   Update available 3.6.1 â†’ 3.6.2        â”‚
OK   Run npm i -g @feathersjs/cli to update
OK - Hi, Iâ€™ve got a short question: is it possible to generate Typescript typings from the backend
     from the services, that can be used to type the feathers-client? name.interface.ts
OK - test name.mongo.js
OK - Also test generic adapter for .js and .ts
OK - New code locations any place its reasonable to add custom code.
     Pay extra attention to the _adapters, _model, _service templates
OK - Consider which generated code to instead make default code, creating a new code location there.
OK - Generated README does not contain the correct cli-plus commands.
OK - uncomment extensions.graphql.name and extensions.graphql.service?
OK - document name.validate.?s


NO - hooks modules should be ifNew: true
NO - should class.js and class-async.js be in their own folder?
NO - lib/generator.js defaultConfig needs to change if config/default.js is to be used
NO - add initial/updating for connections. Right now we just mention first ever connection.
NO - in graphql, feathers-batch-loader.js#serializeRecordKey & serializeDataLoaderKey should use
NO   feathers-plus-common/object/sortKeys if param is object to organize props in order
NO   else the two won't be considered "equal".
NO   --> Let user handle this as we think object keys will be rarely used. 
NO - Let's say we had mongodb services and changed them to NeDB. connentions['mongodb+mongodb'] will
NO   remain. This causes, for example, src/mongodb.js to still be generated.
NO   Basically, the generator does not remove info in specs that's no longer relavent.
NO - If we gen an NeDB service & add custom code to name.service.js. Then we regen to mongo. Then we
     regen back to NeDB. We do not include the previous custom code for NeDB. We could have
     diff insertion point names for each adapter, nedb_import, mongo_import. We could write a
     module (not called from anywhere) containing all scanned custom code that has not been used in
     the current regen. That module is basically a container for custom code we no longer use.\
     It can be scanned every regen. So it we regen from mongo to nedb, we'd pick up the custom
     code that was stashed away before.
     Main problem: If we regen a service, we have to know which modules contain custom code we have
     to consider for stashing. Basically, if we regen middleware, we won't be regen'ing graphql, so
     scanned graphql custom code would not be used in the regen. Yet we don't want to stash this.
NO - Check node version is 8+ (6+) in feathers-plus/cli. Already checked in lib/generator.js   
NO - "Hi, anyone knows how to make feathers-cli generate services in plural mode but model in singular mode?
     its ok to use plural for services, but kind of wired for models"  

- prevent reserved words being used as service names. Exclude graphql also. https://www.npmjs.com/package/reserved-words
- add ?!? notNullFields: [] in JSON-schema? Need to update validation, mongodb, mongoose
- Do we create `db.collection.createIndex({ fieldName: 1 }, { unique: true })`
  for `uniqueItemProperties`? In say name.mongo.js?

- Handle memberIds[] for batchloaders.
- Any custom code found that is not reinserted into regenerated modules is cached in a temp module
  so you can cut/paste it if needed.
- Cache hashes for all default code created in a module.
  When scanning for custom code, compare any default code found to the cached hash.
  This would find code where <DEFAULT> was not removed.

- add elasticsearch support when generating a database
- I think if we were to do migrations they shoudl be feathers based, i.e. db agnostic (as far as SQL vs NoSQL allows)
- gen code if server is part of a set of microservices.

- test name.validate.js
- add option: run tslint --fix / eslint --fix afterwards ?!? (watch for removal of trailing commas
  Alternatively have pretty-stringify produce single rather than double quotes.
- add comment in hooks regarding context.params.graphql for services included in graphql
- add sort one 1 prop in array of objects, sort on multiple prop names to BatchLoader. See f-x/common-utils
- what is feathersjs/cli/lib/shell.js

- prompt for softDelete (after testing discard('password') on users with auth)
- prompt and inert feathers-authentication-management. Need to handle arrays for SQL servers.
  - Will need to update feathersjs/authentication to check some extra fields
  - Figure out how to define schema for extra fields in Sequelize/PSQL,... and Knex/...
  - Handle outstanding issue with repo.
  - Write sample emails.
- prompt for i18n support  
- what can we do with feathers-sync?

- validation pass over services/name.schema.*s
- error checking pass over specs (plus some custom code),
  e.g. email/password exists in schema of user-entity when local auth selected.

- create Knex schema
- finalize and test support for Knex services.
- add docs example with memberIds: [...] to tests
- support memberIds: [...] in batchloaders

- add async init https://github.com/feathersjs/feathers/issues/509
- add stress test https://blog.feathersjs.com/stress-testing-your-feathersjs-application-like-in-production-4b8611ee8d9e
- add async feathers startup
- how to override ErrorHandler (a generator?)
- create fastJoin definitions
- create definitions for swagger
- create rate limiter for socket.io. luc.claustres asked about one on Slack
- expand generator for authentication
    - optionally include Basic Authentication ??!??
    - optionally include feathers-authentication-management (which may use a refactoring)
- create generator for deployment   
- create workflow. luc.claustres asked about one on Slack.
- generate for feathers-client (Vue, Redux, etc)
- bring dependencies up to date

- Allow last hook to execute e.g.
    .hooks({
      before: {
        all: [first],
        find: [second]
      }
    }).hooks({
      before: [ last ]
    });

- tests:
describe('Feathers application tests', () => {
  before(function (done) {
    this.server = stoppable(app.listen(port), 0);
    this.server.once('listening', () => done());
  });

  after(function (done) {
    this.server.stop(done);
  });

FINAL CHECKS
- Consistency, e.g. name.sequelize.js lists needed fields for user-entity while others don't.


- Several templates may have the same app module as their destination. Each of these
  templates needs to be tested for .ts .
  - src/models/name.model.*s
    - knex for the user-entity service
    - knex for other service
    OK - mongoose for the user-entity service
    OK - mongoose for other service
    OK - nedb for the user-entity service
    OK - nedb for other service
    OK - sequelize for the user-entity service
    OK - sequelize for other service
  - src/services/name/name.service.*s
    OK - mongo service
    - rethink service
    OK - other adapters use a common template
  - src/*.*s
    - knex.*s
    OK - mongodb.*s
    OK - mongoose.*s
    - rethinkdb.*s
    - sequelize.*s for MS SQL Server
    OK - sequelize.*s for other DBs use a common template
